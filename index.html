                    <p>Disco was a lot more than just a style of music.</p>
                    <p>For marginalized populations in the early seventies, namely people of color and gays,
                    the disco lifestyle was an empowering outlet for sexual and personal freedoms. While
                    white youths were experiencing free love and hippy sensibilites in the sixties, minorities in America
                    were still fighting for basic civil rights.</p>
                    <p>Dance music and the club culture of the early discos allowed the oppressed to forget their problems
                    and indulge in the same freedoms that white youths were already entitled to for over a decade.</p>
                    <p><b>Early disco music was almost entirely black-owned and black operated and
                    became extremeley popular WITHOUT the help of commercial radio airplay . </b></p>

          <h2>The Loft</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike most clubs, the Loft was a non-commercial dance venue that served no alcohol, food or beverages.
            Opened on Valentine's Day 1970 by DJ David Manusco, it quickly became one of the epicenters of gay nightlife in New York City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the Loft was a private party destination and not a public dance club, police could not habitually raid and arrest
            gay partygoers. Events at the Loft were also equalizing -- there were no cover charges or expensive drinks. Everyone, despite class
            background, could attend these events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although beatmatching music together was the norm by most DJs at the time, Manusco instead played tracks the entire way through, with small gaps in between tracks.
            He had an extreme admiration for the disco music played and wanted to enjoy the songs in their entirety. Partygoers enjoyed hearing their favorite sogns on Manusco's soundsytem,
            regarded as one of the best in it's time.
