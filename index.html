            <h2 class="early">The Disco Revolution</h2>
                    <p>Disco was a lot more than just a style of music.</p>
                    <p>For marginalized populations in the early seventies, namely people of color and gays,
                    the disco lifestyle was an empowering outlet for sexual and personal freedoms. While
                    white youths were experiencing free love and hippy sensibilites in the sixties, minorities in America
                    were still fighting for basic civil rights.</p>
                    <p>Dance music and the club culture of the early discos allowed the oppressed to forget their problems
                    and indulge in the same freedoms that white youths were already entitled to for over a decade.</p>
                    <p><b>Early disco music was almost entirely black-owned and black operated and
                    became extremeley popular WITHOUT the help of commercial radio airplay . </b></p>

          <h2>The Loft</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike most clubs, the Loft was a non-commercial dance venue that served no alcohol, food or beverages.
            Opened on Valentine's Day 1970 by DJ David Manusco, it quickly became one of the epicenters of gay nightlife in New York City.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the Loft was a private party destination and not a public dance club, police could not habitually raid and arrest
            gay partygoers. Events at the Loft were also equalizing -- there were no cover charges or expensive drinks. Everyone, despite class and
            background, could attend these events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although beatmatching music together was the norm by most DJs at the time, Manusco instead played tracks the entire way through, with small gaps in between each song.
            He had an extreme admiration for the disco music played and wanted to enjoy the songs in their entirety. Partygoers enjoyed hearing their favorite sogns on Manusco's soundsytem,
            regarded as one of the best in it's time.

          <h2>Paradise Garage and Larry Levan</h2>
          <p>Paradise Garage followed in the footsteps of the Loft: it didn't serve alcohol or food and operated on a membership-only basis to avoid police raids.
          However, the Garage could hold over 3,000 people and was the second largest club in New York City in the late seventies.</p>
          <p>The club was specifically designed for the on-the-rise DJ, Larry Levan. He became the resident DJ at the club and was known for his legendary "Saturday Night Mass" DJ sets.
          Levan was a daring DJ -- mixing disco with gospel sermons, classic soul and rock music. He consistently surprised people during his night-long DJ sets and kept people dancing for hours.

          <h2>Birth of the disco 12"</h2>
          <p>Before the birth of disco, vinyl records were exclusively pressed for purchase in either the LP or 7" single format.
          But with the rise of the DJ, disco clubs and mixing songs, DJ promotional copies of single songs began to be pressed. The 12-inch single
          format was more desirable to disc jockeys because they were easier to mix with than the other formats. </p>
          <p>In 1976, a small NYC record label called Salsoul decided to hold a contest for the best remix of the song, <i>Ten Percent</i> by Double Exposure.
          DJ Walter Gibbons created a daunting nine-minute rendition of the oringally three-minute long track that stole the show and won the contest. Gibbon's remixed version of the song
          later became the first commercially available 12-inch disco single in the world. At this point, Salsoul, as well as other record labels across the country,
          realized the financial benefits of pressing commercially-available remixes. </p>
